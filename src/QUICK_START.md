## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Admin Portal" link not visible?**
→ Scroll down on Welcome screen, it's below the main buttons

**Charts not loading?**
→ Refresh the page, Recharts needs a moment to initialize

**Navigation stuck?**
→ Click back buttons or logout to reset

**Mobile view too wide in Admin?**
→ Admin is designed for desktop - switch back to user app for mobile
